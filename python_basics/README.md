## Python basics

### datatypes.py
`-`Initializes python datatypes and performs conversion of int data type from int to float and from float to int\
`-`To run it, run ```python3 datatypes.py``` on your command line

### control_structures.py
`-`Uses if, elif, else statements and while loops to print a series of numbers and determine if a number is even or odd\
`-`To run it, run ```python3 control_structures.py``` on your command line

### modular_functions.py
`-`Calculates the are of triangle, circle and rectangle based on the parameters passed to the function\
`-`To run it, run ```python3 modular_functions.py``` on your command line

I learnt about python datatypes, control structures: if, else, while loops, and writing code in a modular way within functions
