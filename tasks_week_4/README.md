## Objectives

### Task 1
- Find the symbolic derivatives of a function and solve for x when the gradient is equated to zero.
- Use the second derivative of the function to check whether the value of x when the gradient is zero is a maximum or minimum turning point.

### Task 2
- Find the symbolic determinant of a given matrix.
- Find the eigenvalues of the matrix using symbolic computation.
- Verify that the eigenvalues satisfy the characteristic equation of the matrix.

### Task 3
- Factor the denominator of a polynomial function.
- Find the inverse Laplace transform of the function.
- Find the poles of the system.

### Task 4
- Find the symbolic derivative of a cost function.
- Find the value of x when cost is minimized, interpret the obtained solution, and come up with a decision based on it.

### Task 5
- Define a symbolic function for a public key encryption system.
- Compute the modular inverse of the plaintext function parameter `P` to decrypt the message.
- Substitute given values into the function to obtain a given ciphertext.

## How to run the files
```sh
python3 [filename]
```

## What I learned from this exercise
- How to use `sympy` to compute symbolic algebraic and calculus functions.
- Performing calculations on matrices.
